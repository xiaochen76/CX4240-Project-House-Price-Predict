When the dataset comes to be high dimensional, it could lead to many problems. Firstly, such high dimension will significantly increase teh training time of the model, and dramatically increase the complexity of the model. Secondly, the model may make decisions based on the noise and thus, cause overfitting. What's more, the meaningless redundent data will be very misleading, and could decrease the accuracy.
